Following up on the successful deployement of the pilot plant in Gilgil, Nakuru County, we proceeded with the design and development of the commercial plant.

The design focused on modularity allowing for the plant to be conainerized and completely built in a factory versus being assembled in the field. This allows for fast and rapid deployements with very low capex.
