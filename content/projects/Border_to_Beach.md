We powered Joel Amboka through this epic journey demonstrating the potential of the Roam Air for every day bikers. This enabled us to showcase how Roam Airâ€™s portable charging feature, battery ownership, and dual-battery system are designed to empower [boda boda riders](https://www.roam-electric.com/newsletter-border-to-border) to ride with no limits.
